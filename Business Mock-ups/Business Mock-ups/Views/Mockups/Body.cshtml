            <p>There is no reason you can't hit the gym. Studies show that weight-lifitng has multiple benefits,
            extending your life, increasing heart health, and improving your mood and relieving stress.
            You don't need to be in there for hours on end, lifting and moving weight to dull music. 
            Spending just 15 minutes, if that's all you can spend, three to four times a week focusing on a muscle group,
            would do you much more than one day a week hitting everything. </p>

            <p>Picture it, you are in your late 40s and can still move like you were in your 20s, in fact you can move ven better
            than that. You have strength and flexibility and have complete control of your body and how you move.
            Every step is an expression of freedom, of art, and a showcase that you just don't move weight, but you have power
            coursing within you.</p>
