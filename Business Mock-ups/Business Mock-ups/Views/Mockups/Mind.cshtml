                <p>This is what your brain is like when you're addicted, doesn't matter to what,
                it could be porn, drugs, televvision, short-form videos. You indulge, indulge, indulge until the usually 'hit' isn't 
                enough. That's when you need more. With other stimulants, like alcohol, drugs, the danger is slow, but it's more vocal,
                more visible. An alcoholic or drug addict can be more easily spotted from a crowd of healthy people.

                unnoticed for some time. But there is a solution, one that requires discipline, dedication and a strong will, 
                do you have what it takes to change your life and your mind and be the warrior you know you can be?</p>
